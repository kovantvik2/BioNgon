You have downloaded the source code of a small program called GC Content Calculator. Maybe everything in this program is not so perfect, but once you have downloaded it, then you need it. The program is written in the C programming language using GTK+ and sqlite3 database sources. Now you need to install the program. In this case, assemble a binary file from the source code and use it directly for your needs. This is done quite easily if you have already installed all the necessary packages and libraries that will be needed to build the program. You also need to install the make utility, There is also a very simple Makefile in the source archive, and that's what the make utility is for. After opening the terminal, you must go directly to the source folder and type "make" (without the quotes, of course). Next, if you have all the necessary dependencies installed, the program will be compiled and in the source folder you will have a folder named "gc_content_calculator", which will contain a binary file and a folder with the interface. You can open a binary (aka executable) file using a terminal.

And yes, you can delete the source folder and move the build folder to any location on your computer.

There is also a test file named "test_dna" in the source folder.

Additional dependencies are installed mainly from the repositories of the operating system using "apt" or "apt-get". (For example: sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk-3-dev).
